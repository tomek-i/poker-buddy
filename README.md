This is a fun and personal project within our group of friends to track our poker performance and win tally.

Currently I have been only working (development branch) on the front-end which is React and pure CSS - yes, all you see is pure CSS. 

At later stages I will implement the backend and database to actually track played games. 

In the future I hope to turn it into an actual playable poker game :-)

**TL;TR**

We occasionally get together for a few games of Poker throughout the year and we have this internal competition,
however we never keep propely track of games played, performance, tally etc.
In the end we estimate who is the winner of the year, which is the reason why we stopped "paying lunches" :-P

I hope with this little app to keep track of personal performance, best hand(s) played, tracking of blinds during the game
and any other feature I might find usefull.
